Protoc plugins for generating graphql schema and go graphql code

If you use microservice architecture with grpc for back-end and graphql api gateway for front-end, you will find yourself
repeating a lot of code for translating from one transport layer to another (which many times may be a source of bugs)

This repository aims to simplify working with grpc trough protocol buffers and graphql by generating code.
