# Plugin protoc-gen-gogql

If you still want to generate go source code instead of graphql then use
http://github.com/99designs/gqlgen plugin, and map all the generated go types with all the generated graphql types.

`protoc-gen-gogql` plugin generates methods for implementing
`github.com/99designs/gqlgen/graphql.Marshaler` and `github.com/99designs/gqlgen/graphql.Unmarshaler` interfaces. Now proto `enum`s, `oneof`s and `map`s will work fine with graphql.

This plugin also creates convenience methods that will implement generated by the `gqlgen` `MutationResolver` and `QueryResolver` interfaces.

## Install

```sh
go install github.com/tailor-inc/go-proto-gql/protoc-gen-gogql@latest
```

The protoc compiler expects to find plugins named `proto-gen-<PLUGIN_NAME>` on the execution `$PATH`.

So first add golang bin directory to the path if it's not already added (also add it to `.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile` depending on the OS you use):

```sh
export PATH=${PATH}:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

## Usage
Run the `protoc` command with the arguments for the installed plugin:

Like this:

```sh
protoc --gql_out=<ADDITIONAL_ARGUMENTS>:<PATH> -I=./api -I=. ./example/codegen/api/pb/*.proto
```

Where `ADDITIONAL_ARGUMENTS` may be provided in the form of `key=value` separated by a comma.

Possible additional arguments:
- `svc` bool - Use service annotations for nodes corresponding to a GRPC call.
- `merge` bool - Merge all the proto files found in one directory into one file.

## Example
```sh
protoc --gogql_out=paths=source_relative:. -I=./api -I=. ./example/codegen/api/pb/*.proto
```
