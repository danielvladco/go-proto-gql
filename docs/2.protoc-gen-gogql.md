# protoc-gen-gogql

If you still want to generate go source code instead of graphql then use
http://github.com/99designs/gqlgen plugin, and map all the generated go types with all the generated graphql types.

`protoc-gen-gogql` plugin generates methods for implementing
`github.com/99designs/gqlgen/graphql.Marshaler` and `github.com/99designs/gqlgen/graphql.Unmarshaler` interfaces. Now proto `enum`s, `oneof`s and `map`s will work fine with graphql.

This plugin also creates convenience methods that will implement generated by the `gqlgen` `MutationResolver` and `QueryResolver` interfaces.

### Install:

```sh
go install github.com/danielvladco/go-proto-gql/protoc-gen-gogql@latest
```

The protoc compiler expects to find plugins named `proto-gen-<PLUGIN_NAME>` on the execution `$PATH`. 

So first add golang bin directory to the path if it's not already added (also add it to `.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile` depending on the OS you use):

```sh
export PATH=${PATH}:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

### Example:
```sh
protoc --gogql_out=gogoimport=false,paths=source_relative:. -I=. -I=./example/ ./example/*.proto
```
