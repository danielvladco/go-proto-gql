# Gateway (PoC)

At this point we have a PoC gateway that will translate the messages on the fly.

The gateway can be configured in two modes:

pointing to a list of grpc endpoints (grpc reflection must be enabled on the grpc servers).
The gateway will query the servers for protobuf descriptors and generate a graphql schema abstract tree.
The requests to the gateway will be transformed on the fly to grpc servers without any additional code generation
or writing any code at all. See `examples/gateway` for usage more info.

## Config the gateway
To configure the gateway create a `config.yaml` file and provide it to our gateway executable via `--config` flag.

For example: `./gateway --config config.yaml`

Gateway config options:

```yaml
# Generate documentation from the comments left in proto files
docs: true

# Cors configuration for more details check https://github.com/rs/cors/blob/master/cors.go#L32
cors: { }

# The address to serve the gateway on (Default :8080)
address: ":8080"

# Start the gateway with TLS
tls:
  # Path to the TLS certificate 
  certificate: ""

  # Path to the TLS private key
  private_key: ""

# gRPC config options (It is made as a separate category because in the future we can add other protocols too,
# such as: OpenAPI, OpenRPC, GraphQL, etc.
grpc:
  # Import paths provided to the proto parser it is similar to `-I` or `--proto_path` flag on `protoc` cli tool.
  # It is required if your services import proto files.
  import_paths:
    - ./api

  services:
    # The gRPC server address
    - address: "localhost:8081"
      # Authentication options to connect to the gRPC server if needed, otherwise will use insecure connection. 
      authentication:
        # Authenticate using TLC
        tls:
          # Path to the TLS certificate 
          certificate: ""

          # Path to the TLS private key
          private_key: ""

      # Enable automatic discovery if the gRPC server has enabled reflection.
      # Cannot be used together with `proto_files` option. 
      reflection: true

      # The entry proto file where the gRPC services are defined. 
      # If your proto files have any dependencies they should be present in one of the specified `import_paths`
      proto_files:
        - ./grpc_service.proto
```

## Docker image
A docker image with the gateway is also available with the latest tags:

To run the gateway using docker run:
```sh
docker run ghcr.io/danielvladco/go-proto-gql/gateway
```

## Example

In this example we will spin up two gRPC servers and a gateway server that points to them.

To run the demo example follow the next steps:
- Go to `./example/gateway/` 
- Run `docker-compose up`
- Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/playground` in your browser
- Have fun sending requests to the gRPC servers directly from your browser!
