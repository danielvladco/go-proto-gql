# Gateway (alpha)

A unified gateway is also possible. Right now a gateway can be spawn up
pointing to a list of grpc endpoints (grpc reflection must be enabled on the grpc servers).
The gateway will query the servers for protobuf descriptors and generate a graphql schema abstract tree.
The requests to the gateway will be transformed on the fly to grpc servers without any additional code generation
or writing any code at all. See `examples/gateway` for usage more info.
