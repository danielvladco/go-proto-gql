# protoc-gen-gql

`protoc-gen-gql` plugin will generate graphql files with extension `.graphqls`
rather than go code which means it can be further used for any other language or framework.

### Install:

```sh
go install github.com/danielvladco/go-proto-gql/protoc-gen-gql@latest
```

The protoc compiler expects to find plugins named `proto-gen-<PLUGIN_NAME>` on the execution `$PATH`.

So first add golang bin directory to the path if it's not already added (also add it to `.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile` depending on the OS you use):

```sh
export PATH=${PATH}:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

### Example:
```sh
protoc --gql_out=paths=source_relative:. -I=. -I=./example/ ./example/*.proto
```
