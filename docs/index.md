# Get Started

There are three ways to use this library:
1. Using the [protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) tool and extending it with plugins to generate [graphql](1.protoc-gen-gql.md) schema and [golang](2.protoc-gen-gogql.md) bindings.
2. Generating the graphql schema using [proto2graphql](3.proto2graphql.md) (use this if you don't want to install `protoc`)
3. Configuring a [gateway](4.gateway.md) that will translate the messages from one protocol to other on the fly.
